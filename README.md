# Hangman Game

## Overview
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to uncover a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn, and the player loses a life. The objective is to guess the entire word correctly before the figure is completely drawn and the game is over.
