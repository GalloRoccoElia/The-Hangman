# Hangman Game

## Overview
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to uncover a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn, and the player loses a life. The objective is to guess the entire word correctly before the figure is completely drawn and the game is over.

## How It Works
- The game starts by selecting a random word.
- The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct letters in the word.
- With each incorrect guess, the hangman figure progresses, bringing the player closer to losing the game.
- If the player successfully guesses all the letters before running out of attempts, they win!

## Features
- Command Line Interface (CLI) for easy text-based gameplay.
- Visual representation of the hangman in the CLI.
- Ability to track and display remaining guesses and guessed letters.

## How to Play
1. Run the program from the command line.
2. Enter letters one by one to guess the word.
3. Try to guess the entire word before the hangman figure is completed.

Enjoy playing and improving your guessing skills!
